## 🮩 Problem Statement

**Title:**
Create a Virtual Herbal Garden that provides an interactive, educational, and immersive experience to users, showcasing the diverse range of medicinal plants used in AYUSH (Ayurveda, Yoga & Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, and Homeopathy).

**Background:**
AYUSH systems rely on thousands of traditional medicinal plants for healing and wellness. However, physical herbal gardens are not accessible to everyone. To bridge this gap, we present **VedaVan** – a virtual, immersive, and interactive herbal garden that brings ancient plant knowledge into the digital era.

**VedaVan** is a web-based 3D Virtual Herbal Garden platform that allows users to explore, learn, and engage with India's vast medicinal plant heritage.
